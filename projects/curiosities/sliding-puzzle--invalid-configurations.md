Suppose I take a picture and break it up into a grid, pick a cell to make blank (so the other pieces can slide), and then randomly place all the pieces. Is it possible to come up with a configuration of picture pieces and blank cell location such that it is impossible to solve the puzzle? You can assume these are the only valid puzzle sizes: 3x3, 3x4, 4x4, 4x5, and 5x5 grids.
