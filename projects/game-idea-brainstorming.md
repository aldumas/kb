You have access to a satellite feed. You are trying to help people get to safety and achieve objectives without getting eaten by zombies. It’s a planning and resources game. Given a group of people you create a plan that involves issuing signals. They follow the plan based on the actions you told them take when certain signals are received. For example, you might have 1 person show himself to the zombies (in a safe area) to attract them away from a location so the other people can move past that point.

Can send tools and weapons via drone.

Could do both elements where you plan and you execute.

Switch people at key points.

Think of ways to add variety to the gameplay.

Add a compelling narrative.

Able to see inside buildings when a person is in there. Some buildings have blueprints which lets you see the rooms. Doesn’t show zombie locations though.

Traps

Guns

Bombs

Base building? Or is that a separate game?

Characters with vulnerability and personality

Demonstrate good values, eg like what Dad Tier wanted to teach. Maybe create a livestream about game building and connecting . Answer questions, try to have questioner available for follow up questions

Skills to help solve puzzles in a variety of ways.

Vulnerability:

- not feeling enough -> image of God
- Powerlessness to save my brother
- Knowing my dad / being known by my children
- Carrying the weight of cancer gene.
- Finding meaning. Is my life meaningful? Do I matter?
- Doubt and redemption
- Loneliness
- Temptation
- Am I saved?
- Fighting trafficking, abortion, childhood cancer, ideologies
- Envy
- Emotion regulation
- Emotional eating
- Dark vs light message broadcast; the chain of messaging leading back to lies about human value. Kingdom of man vs God
- Abortion and human value (can relate to the messaging idea)
- Is my relationship with God real or just in my head? Trying to experience him in the world and believing there is something that connects us, but struggling with doubt. Will he bring me home?

Everything skit

Another game: you don’t control the hero: you lay the scene for the hero to make decisions. You can stop time. Maybe rewind . To respond to unexpected decisions.

A game where the hero is dying. Try to leave a legacy. Judgment day. Review how people responded to you. See the impact of your life from others eyes. Help you see wha really matters. Heartbeats

Phone monster: responds to noise. If you are too loud, it will get you . It comes and goes. The game is to quietly pick up your toys (or play) for a limited period of time.

Eye in the sky. First day on the job, before the outbreak. Tutorial

Could have some lifeline resources to save the characters in case the plan goes wrong.

Laxer mirrors

Daily procedural game. Everyone gets the same experience per day. 1 level per day.

A game that contrasts the kingdom of God vs man. Eg value and beauty and worth.

What is a simple game Andrew would think is fun and funny? And can I add some wholesomeness to it?

Opportunity cost game. What if opportunity cost was not a thing?

Stealth game where you have to trim your neighbors bushes because they are blocking your view without your neighbor catching you.

Something silly about weeding.

Vertical scroller about bird pooping. Flight up and down, speed changing, precision targeting
