For a class named `Hello` in package `com.misterinevitable` which contains a `main` method, you execute the program like this, assuming the `classpath` points to a directory which contains the `com` directory:

```sh
java com.misterinevitable.Hello
```

Note that you specify the fully-qualified class name, not the filename.
