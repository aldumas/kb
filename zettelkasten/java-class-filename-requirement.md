The base filename must match the name of a `public` class in the file. There can be other non-`public` classes inside the file but no other `public` ones. This is used by the `javac` and `java` executables in order to find and process / load classes.

The file must live in a directory corresponding to its #package.

See [[compiling-java-programs]] and [[executing-java-programs]].
