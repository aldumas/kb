Signature of `main` method:
```java
public static void main(String[] args)
```

This method will be invoked when starting the program.

It is OK to have multiple `main` methods. This can be used to test each class as you build it.

When `main` returns, it always returns `0` to the OS. If you want to return a different value, use `System.exit()`.
