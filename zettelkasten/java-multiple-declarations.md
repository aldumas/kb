You can combine multiple [[java-declarations|declarations]] *of the same type* into a single statement, e.g.

```java
int x, y;
```

You can [[java-initialization|initialize]] some or all of them in the statement.

```java
int x, y = 42;
int a = 9, b;
int m = 5, n = 7;
```

#advice Only declare a single variable in a statement.
