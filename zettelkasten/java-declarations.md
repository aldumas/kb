Before you can use a variable, you must declare and [[java-initialization|initialize]] it.

To declare a variable, you list the type and variable name. E.g.

```java
int age;
```

You can also use the [[java-keyword-var|var keyword]] to declare the variable if you initialize it in the same statement.

Java supports [[java-multiple-declarations|multiple declarations]] in a single statement.
