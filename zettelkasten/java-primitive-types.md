Java has the following primitive data types:

1. 4 [[java-integral-types|signed integral]] types
2. 2 [[java-floating-point-types|floating point]] types
3. a [[java-char-type|character]] type
4. a [[java-boolean-type|boolean]] type

All of these types have reference types associated with them, and autoboxing and unboxing are supported.
